 The portfolio in the folder is purely made out of HTML. In the folder there are 4 HTML files for main, project, skills, and contacts page.To get the file click the "code" and clone the code. In vs code you can use Live server and click "Go Live" to see its output. If you don't have it yet. Download it in your vs code in extension. The tags that I used aside from <html>, <body>, <head>, and <meta> is <h1>, <p>, <a>, <ul>, <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, <form>, <input>, and <label>.
