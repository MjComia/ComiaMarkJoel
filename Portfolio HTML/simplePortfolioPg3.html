          Intermediate. That is the level of proficiency of this language
          because C++/C is like the most manual language that you could use. In
          this language, you can use differnt libraries but its not that
          recommended because the purpose of the language is to know how things
          or functions work.

          Advanced. It is quite hard for me because I haven't really focused on
          this language. Additionally, this is hard because this program
          incorporates object oriented programming. OOP is average on its
          difficulty but sometimes its just complex. I also implemented database
          on my programs using MySql and I could say it is also hard to
          understand sometimes.
