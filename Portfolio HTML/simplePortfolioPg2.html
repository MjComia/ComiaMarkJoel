        <td>1. Comrpession and Decompression</td>
        <td>
          The goal of the program is to simply compress the text file into a
          smaller size. If used, you will notice that the size of the compressed
          file is smaller than the original. If you decompress it will return to
          its original size. The program used huffman tree algorithm and I
          collaborated this work with Kenneth Balbon.

        <td>2. Student/Teacher Portal</td>
        <td>
          The program is used to make a student's and teacher's portal. In the
          portal, if you are a teacher, you can put student's information in it
          like grades and their names. If you are a student you can see your
          grades. What is unique about this is it has GUI(Graphical user
          interface).

        <td>3. Banking System</td>
        <td>
          The program is like an ATM machine. You can make an account, withdraw,
          deposit, and make a cash transfer. One of the unique features of this
          program is that you can use a flash drive as your atm card and it also
          has a password that is encrypted so it won't be easily hacked.
